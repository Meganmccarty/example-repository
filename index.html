                This website demonstrates the knowledge I've learned during Flatiron's Software Engineering 
                "Prework" Program. I've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how each is used in 
                creating websites. This website is structured with HTML, and the various fonts, colors, and styling
                are applied using CSS. Finally, the bit of interactivity on this website is all thanks to JavaScript. :)
