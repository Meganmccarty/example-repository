                creating websites. This website is structured with HTML, and the various fonts, colors, and styling
                are applied using CSS. Finally, the bit of interactivity on this website is all thanks to JavaScript. :)

                Below, I have some sample kinds of insects you might come across. To learn more about each kind, 
                you can click on the image, and more information will appear! You'll also notice that I have some different 
                types of insects listed as buttons; clicking on a button will give you a different set of insects to view!

                        The Pipevine Swallowtail (<i>Battus philenor</i>) is a poisonous butterfly. The catepillars feed 
                        on pipevines, which are a toxic plant to many vertebrates. Many other species of butterflies 
                        (and even some moths!) mimic the Pipevine Swallowtail's coloration to protect themselves from 
                        predators, such as birds.

                        The Great Spangled Fritillary (<i>Speyeria cybele</i>) is one of the most common orange butterflies 
                        in the eastern US. Rather than spend the winter as a chrysalis like most butterflies, Great Spangled 
                        Fritillaries spend the harsh winter as tiny caterpillars; they hide themselves in leaf litter to survive
                        the cold. Once spring comes, the caterpillars become active and feed on different kinds of violets.

                        Black Swallowtails (<i>Papilio polyxenes</i>) are a common butterfly that can be an occasional garden pest 
                        as caterpillars; the caterpillars feed on dill, parsley, and carrot. Males can be distinguished from females 
                        by a wide yellow band of spots across their wings (as seen in this photo); females have a much narrower band 
                        of yellow spots and a larger swathe of blue on their hind wings.

                        Female Clouded Sulphurs (<i>Colias philodice</i>) come in two color forms: yellow and white, with the white form 
                        shown here. Males are almost always yellow, and this yellow color is how the butterfly gets its common name 
                        of "sulphur". There is another similar species, the Orange Sulphur (<i>Colias eurytheme</i>), that often interbreeds 
                        with the Clouded Sulphur, creating hybrids that contain characteristics of both species. This makes 
                        identification a sometimes challenging task!

                        The Juniper Hairstreak (<i>Callophrys gryneus</i>) is one of the few green butterflies one can find in the 
                        eastern US. Males often patrol around their host plant, eastern juniper, in search of females, and they 
                        rarely come visit flowers. However, when they do want nectar, one of their favorite flowers is that 
                        of eastern redbud, as shown in this photo.

                        The Common Buckeye (<i>Junonia coenia</i>) is a butterfly that prefers warmer climates. Each year, this species 
                        moves northward with warmer summer weather. However, unlike the Monarch, which migrates south during the fall, 
                        the Common Buckeye does not migrate and continues breeding until the first frost kills them off in the northern 
                        and midwestern parts of its range. They survive perfectly fine in the south, so there is always a stable population 
                        ready to invade the north once summer returns.

                        Cecropia moths (<i>Hyalophora cecropia</i>) are the largest moths in North America. They are 
                        larger than the largest North American butterfly, which is the Eastern Giant Swallowtail 
                        (<i>Papilio cresphontes</i>).

                        The Oak Leaffolder moth (<i>Ancylis burgessiana</i>) belongs to a group of moths collectively 
                        referred to as "micro moths" due to their tiny size. Oak Leaffolder moths are so named because, 
                        as caterpillars, they create a pleat, or a "fold" in a leaf and feed within this safe shelter.

                        The Promethea moth (<i>Callosamia promethea</i>) is a type of silkmoth that flies both during the day 
                        and at night. However, the males fly strictly during the day (mimicking the poisonous Pipevine Swallowtail) 
                        in search of females with which to mate. The females, on the other hand, fly strictly during the night to lay 
                        eggs. Mating occurs during the day, though the female does not fly; she releases pheromones into the air, and 
                        the male homes in on her by following her scent trail.

                        Another photo of a Cecropia moth (<i>Hyalophora cecropia</i>). As with all silkmoths, Cecropia moths do 
                        not have mouthparts as adults (notice the lack of a proboscis in the photo). Because of this, the adults 
                        do not eat and must survive off of the fats they stored away as caterpillars. They only live for about 1-2 
                        weeks, enough time to mate and lay eggs.

                        The Io moth (<i>Automeris io</i>) is another type of silkmoth. Io moths belong to a subgroup of silkmoths 
                        called buck moths; as caterpillars, buck moths are special in that they have stinging spines along their bodies.
                        While the sting of an Io moth caterpillar is pretty mild, those allergic to insect stings can experience a more 
                        extreme reaction. Luckily, the adults do not have stinging spines and can safely be handled.

                        The Elegant Grass-veneer moth (<i>Microcrambus elegans</i>) is another example of a micro moth. One can identify 
                        this species by its wing pattern: a "frowning face" can be made out in the center of its wings when they are held 
                        along its body (as shown in the photo). Much like its common name suggests, Elegant Grass-veneer moths feed on a variety 
                        of grass species as caterpillars.

                        Red Milkweed beetles (<i>Tetraopes tetrophthalmus</i>) are an extremely common beetle that can be found on 
                        common milkweed flowers (the same species of milkweed that Monarch butterflies use). While Red Milkweed beetles 
                        have similar coloration to ladybugs, one can distinguish them by their much longer bodies and super long antennae.

                        Blister beetles (family Meloidae) are so named due to a defensive chemical they secrete that can cause burns. The 
                        chemical, called cantharidin, is a burn agent and a poison in large doses, and it is classified as an extremely 
                        hazardous substance in the US (though, historically, it was used as an aphrodisiac!) Because of how potent 
                        cantharidin is, it is best not to touch blister beetles!
