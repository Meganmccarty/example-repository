        <h1>Welcome to my Insect Website!</h1>
        <section id="intro">
            <p>
                This website demonstrates the knowledge I've learned during Flatiron's Software Engineering 
                "Prework" Program. I've learned about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and how each is used in 
                creating websites. This website is structured with HTML, and the various fonts, colors, and styling
                are applied using CSS. Finally, the bit of interactivity on this website is all thanks to JavaScript. :)
            </p>
            <p>
                Below, I have some sample kinds of insects you might come across. To learn more about each kind, 
                you can click on the image, and more information will appear! You'll also notice that I have some different 
                types of insects listed as buttons; clicking on a button will give you a different set of insects to view!
